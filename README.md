# ADR
This project uses ADR to [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to record architecture decisions.
After installing the tool ensure to execute

`adr init doc/architecture/decisions`

but delete the new `*-record-architecture-decisions.md`

This is so it would sync the output directory so that subsequent docs are placed under `doc/architecture` otherwise the default will go into `doc/adr/`
